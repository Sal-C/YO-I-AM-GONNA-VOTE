# Yo! I'm 'onna Vote!
It’s no secret that access to voting in the United States can vary dramatically depending on which state, county, and municipality you reside in. With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, uncertainty about one’s voting status, options for casting a ballot, and whether or not there will be a nearby location where a ballot can be cast safely and timely has only exacerbated the existing problem.
Further, even if an individual is registered and able to cast a ballot, most of us lead busy lives that make following political developments challenging. Often, it can be next to impossible determining who your elected officials are and where they stand on the issues of the day.

- So that, if not, I can fill out an online application that will ensure I am.
- As a member of my community, I want to know when and where I am able to vote and how.
- Given that voting requires being  knowledgeable, I want to know what district I live in, who my  elected officials are, and how to contact them.
